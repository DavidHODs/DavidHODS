I am a Software Engineer (with backend and devops expertise). My stack is Go, Python and Haskell plus devops tools such as Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Ansible, AWS, Git and Others.

I'm not a consistent writer (for now) but you can still checkout some of the technical articles I have on my [blog page](https://decode.hashnode.dev/).

**Here's a quick summary about me**:

- 💡 Fun fact: I'm a devops/cloud engineering graduate of [AltSchool Africa'23](https://altschoolafrica.com/schools/engineering)
- 😊 I’m looking for help with open source projects, hackathons, internships, and entry-level opportunities.
- 💼 Job interests: Software Engineering jobs that span across backend, devops and cloud
