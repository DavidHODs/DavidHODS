# Hello there; welcome 👋🏾  

I am a **Software Engineer** with an interdisciplinary background spanning **science technologies (chemistry/biochemistry), cloud engineering & DevOps, and computer science**. I take a **pragmatic engineering approach**, using the best tools for the problem rather than being tied to a single stack.  

I can **conveniently jump into projects** built with **TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Haskell and DevOps technologies** without needing days (or a week) to ramp up.  

## **Quick Summary About Me:**  

- 🎓 **Interdisciplinary Education**:  
  - Science Technologies (Chemistry/Biochemistry)  
  - Cloud Engineering & DevOps (AltSchool Africa'23 Graduate)  
  - Computer Science (BSc, expected August '25)  
- 💼 **Backend Engineer** currently building **Holiday Alot**  
- 📊 **Exploring Data Engineering & AI**  
- 📚 Fast learner, continuously adapting to new technologies  
- 🚀 Open to **collaborations, open-source projects, and hackathons**
